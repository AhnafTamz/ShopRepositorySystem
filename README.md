# ShopRepositorySystem
 
 SHOP REPOSITORY SYSTEM :

 Hello, This is a MVC Application for shop repository system.
 the backend was written in ASP.NET Core framework & in C# and the frontend is in Angular.

 Here, you will find a Model-View-Controller approach where the models for this system are in Model folder and there are 
 four controllers where CRUD operations are performed for Vendor,Shops and Customers. So, this is a three layer system 
 where Vendor sells to Shops and Shops sell to Customers.

 This is a pretty basic layout & can be used as a template for a 3 layered shop repository system but it needs a lot
 of works to be done on it. 

 Thank You.
